          1. General Information
        </h2>
        <p>
          At ShopperGlobal, we offer two categories of shipping, depending on
          the product you purchase:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold">International Dropshipping Products:</strong>
            <p>
              These products are sourced from overseas suppliers. Once your
              order is placed, we import the product into India from our overseas
              warehouse, which involves a lead time for customs clearance and
              transit.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold">Domestic Warehouse Products:</strong>
            <p>
              Some products are stocked in our India-based warehouse and are
              available for quicker shipping. These products are clearly marked
              on our website and are shipped directly within India.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

          2. Shipping Methods & Estimated Delivery Times
        </h2>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">
          A. International Dropshipping Products
        </h3>
        <p>
          For products sourced from overseas suppliers, the estimated delivery
          time includes two key phases:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold">Import Lead Time:</strong>
            <p>
              After you place an order, we initiate the process of importing the
              product from our overseas suppliers into India. This can take
              approximately 10 to 12 business days, depending on supplier
              location, customs processing, and logistics.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold">Domestic Shipping After Import:</strong>
            <p>
              Once the product arrives in India and clears customs, we will ship
              it to you using a reliable domestic courier. Domestic shipping
              typically takes 3 to 6 business days, depending on your location.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p className="font-semibold mt-2">
          Total Estimated Delivery Time for International Products: 12 to 20
          business days from the date of order placement.

          <li>Metro Cities: 3 to 5 business days</li>
          <li>Non-Metro Cities: 5 to 7 business days</li>
        </ul>
